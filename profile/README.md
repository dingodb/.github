**3. S3 Protocol Compatibility**

DingoFS supports standard S3 interface protocols for streamlined access to filesystem namespace resources.

**4. Fully Distributed Architecture**

DingoFS's metadata Service (MDS), data storage layer, caching system, and client components all support linear scalability.

**5. Exceptional Performance**

Combines SSD-level low-latency responsiveness with object storage-grade elastic throughput capacity.

**6. Intelligent Caching Acceleration System**

DingFS implements a three-tier caching topology (memory/local SSD/distributed cluster) to deliver high-throughput, low-latency intelligent I/O acceleration for AI workloads.

## Get Start
### 1. Setup Dingo-eureka and Dingo-sdk
If you installed the software using a [Docker](./Docs/Docker.md) container, the container already includes pre-integrated [Dingo-eureka](https://github.com/dingodb/dingo-eureka) and [Dingo-sdk](https://github.com/dingodb/dingo-sdk), no additional installation is required.

### 2. Install jemalloc
```shell
wget https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/download/5.3.0/jemalloc-5.3.0.tar.bz2
tar -xjvf jemalloc-5.3.0.tar.bz2
cd jemalloc-5.3.0 && ./configure && make && make install
```

### 3. Download dep
```sh
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 4. Build Etcd Client
```sh
bash build_thirdparties.sh
```

### 5. Build
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 32
```

## Developing DingoFS
### Install Dependencies
We recommend Rocky and Ubuntu to develop the DingoFS codebase.
### GCC 13
We recommend using GCC 13 as the primary compiled language.

# 3. Dingo-HFMirror{#header3}
[HFMirror](https://github.com/dingodb/dingo-hfmirror) is a self-hosted Hugging Face mirror service designed and developed by [DataCanvas](https://www.datacanvas.com/), which provides users with a convenient and efficient solution for accessing and managing model resources. Through local mirroring, users can reduce their reliance on remote Hugging Face servers, improve resource acquisition speed, and achieve local storage and management of data.

## Key Features

**1. Mirror Acceleration**

Cache the resources downloaded for the first time. When the client makes a subsequent request, the data will be read from the cache and returned, greatly improving the download rate.

**2. Convenient Access**

There is no need for scientific internet access or complex network configuration. Simply deploy the dingo-hfmirror service and use it as the proxy address to easily complete the download.

**3. Traffic Reduction and Load Alleviation**

Download once and use multiple times, reducing the traffic waste caused by repeated downloads, which is efficient and saves traffic.

**4. Localized Management**

Cover the entire process of local compilation, deployment, monitoring, and usage of the mirror service, bringing an excellent and flexible experience. It avoids reliance on external networks and public mirror repositories, significantly improving the system's response speed and data security.

## Installation
The project uses the wire command to generate the required dependency code. Install the wire command as followsï¼š
```
# Import into the project
go get -u github.com/google/wire

# Install the command
go install github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire
```
Wire is a flexible dependency injection tool that completes dependency injection at compile time by automatically generating code. In the dependency relationships between various components, explicit initialization is usually used instead of passing global variables. Therefore, using Wire to initialize the code can effectively solve the coupling between components and improve code maintainability.

> This project uses go mod to manage dependencies and requires Go version 1.23 or higher. It uses makefile to manage the project and requires the make command.

```
# 1. Install dependencies
make init

# 2. Generate code
make wire

# 3. Compile the executable file for the current system version
make build

# 4. Compile the Linux executable file on macOS
make macbuild

# 5. Add a license to each file
make license
```

## Quick Start

Deploy the compiled binary file and execute ./dingo-hfmirror to start the service. Then set the environment variable HF_ENDPOINT to the mirror site (here it is http://localhost:8090/).

Linux:
```
export HF_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8090
```
Windows Powershell:
```
$env:HF_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8090"
```
From now on, all download operations in the Hugging Face library will be proxied through this mirror site. You can install the Python library to try it out:
```
pip install -U huggingface_hub
```
```
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

snapshot_download(repo_id='Qwen/Qwen-7B', repo_type='model',
local_dir='./model_dir', resume_download=True,
max_workers=8)
```
Alternatively, you can use the Hugging Face CLI to directly download models and datasets. Download GPT2:
```
huggingface-cli download --resume-download openai-community/gpt2 --local-dir gpt2
```
Download a single file:
```
huggingface-cli download --resume-download --force-download  HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-256M-Instruct config.json
```
Download WikiText:
```
huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset --resume-download Salesforce/wikitext --local-dir wikitext
```
You can view the path ./repos, where the caches of all datasets and models are stored.



## How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of dingo on GitHub.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on GitHub is called origin.
- Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on. Branch from develop.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of Google code style, including indentation.
- If the project has tests run them!
- Add unit tests that test your new code.
- In general, avoid changing existing tests, as they also make sure the existing public API is
  unchanged.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase.
- Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, the remote origin.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the Dingo's develop branch.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local
  repo and delete your branch.
- Last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message
  should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
